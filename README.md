## Message
Welcome to the repository that contains the code that was used for the analyses in the manuscript.
We have collated all the relevant code and put it into google colab where you should be able to run the code with minimal edits.
Do drop us a message on Github or through email if you encounter any issues.

Update [07 July 2022]: With new results (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.12.468350v2), the colab code has expanded and is not fully compatible with Google colab. Some parts should be run locally. The sections have been organised chronologically as much as possible. Should you get stuck on trying to replicate the analysis, do drop me a message.

Cheers!<br>
